		 enter - view selected user's processes tree
		     i - toggle between users idle time and their command line
		     t - view all system processes (tree from init)

when viewing processes tree:

	cursor up,down - move cursor 
		 enter - go back to users list
		     t - view all system processes (tree from init)
		     o - display owner of each process
	     Control I - send INT signal to selected process
	     Control K - send KILL signal to selected process
	PageUp, PageDown, Home, End

x - refresh, force to read utmp file once again if for some reason
    there is an user on display which logged out from the system.

at the bottom of the screen.

Whowatch 1.2

Whowatch is Linux ncurses who-like utility which displays informations about 
logged in users in real time. 
Beside standard information (login, tty, host, user's process) you can 
see type of login (ie. ssh, telnet). Now you can also see selected user's 
processes tree.

Whowatch should compile on any Linux machine.
(was tested on Slackware and few RedHat's)

To compile just type 'make'.

You can edit whowatch.h and change few parameters:
- disable automatic refresh of processes list (if you do this you can manually
update the list by pressing 'w' key)
- disable colors
- change default locations of utmp and wtmp files.

KEYS:
	cursor up,down - move cursor 
			 (you can use it even if viewing tree)
	enter	       - toggle between users list and processes tree
	t - show users idle time or their commands 
	i - view all system processes (tree from init)
	r - to redraw
	x - to restart
	q - quit
	optional:
	w -  to update list of processes (if compiled with -DNOAUTO)

more to come.

If you want to use whowatch you have to have read access to /proc
, wtmp and utmp.


Known bugs: 
Whowatch depends on utmp and wtmp files. If some program doesn't write
to wtmp file whowatch has no way to know that user logged in or logged 
out. There is such a problem with xterm. If you have for example four
opened xterms then run whowatch, it will show you four logins as type 
'(xterm)'. But if you close one of these xterms whowatch still will be 
displaying four xterm logins. You have to press 'x' key to update data.

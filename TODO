Some ideas:
- make whowatch aware of screen resizing (switching from ncurses to slang 
  library?).
- add ability to display process' open files. If file is a socket then 
  display IP addresses or host names (needs smart helper-resolver)
- add configuration file where user could specify what program to launch
  when hitting key in users list mode. You could then select user and run
  ie. ttysnoop on the appropriate tty.
  
If you have some other ideas you are welcome to send me an email.
